# Drug Recommendation System



The **Drug Recommender System** is a machine learning-powered web application that helps users discover relevant drugs based on symptoms or effects they input. It uses text-based similarity matching and predictive modeling to identify and suggest potential drug names, along with detailed drug information such as pregnancy category, alcohol interaction level, and more.

This project demonstrates how data science, natural language processing (NLP), and modern deployment tools like Streamlit can be combined to create real-world, user-focused applications.
